# Recursion-visualizer
A Javascript project that visualizes backtracking process that occurs in the  recursion stack.
The idea originated from the Leetcode problem "Unique Path".
The problem states that we have to find the number of ways/paths a Robot placed at the top-left corner of an N x N grid can move to reach the bottom-right corner.
The problem is solved using Dynamic Programming. 

The bruteforce approach however involves an interesting pattern that simulates the actual motion of the Robot, Which in theory isnt the optimal solution but the backtracking path is an interesting visual to observe.

The project is deployed on Netlify.
